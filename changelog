      features: @overload outside stubs, Reversible, DefaultDict, Text,
      ContextManager, Type[], NewType(), TYPE_CHECKING, and numerous bug
      fixes (note that some of the new features are not yet implemented in
      mypy or other static analyzers).  Also classes for PEP 492

      doing partial writes, but this is deprecated.
    - Issue #26809: Add ``__all__`` to :mod:`string`.

      bytes found in redirect target URLs.  Some servers send Location header
      fields with non-ASCII bytes, but "http.client" requires the request
      target to be ASCII-encodable, otherwise a UnicodeEncodeError is raised.
    - Issue #26892: Honor debuglevel flag in urllib.request.HTTPHandler.

    - Issue #26804: urllib.request will prefer lower_case proxy environment
      variables over UPPER_CASE or Mixed_Case ones.
    - Issue #26837: assertSequenceEqual() now correctly outputs non-stringified
      differing items (like bytes in the -b mode).

    - Issue #21668: Link audioop, _datetime, _ctypes_test modules to libm.
    - Issue #26799: Fix python-gdb.py: don't get C types once when the Python

  * Update to 20151011 from the 3.5 branch.
    - Idle updates.
    - Issue #24402: Fix input() to prompt to the redirected stdout when

      longer formatted twice.
    - Issue #25003: On Solaris 11.3 or newer, os.urandom() now uses the
      getrandom() function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy()
      function is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom()
      doesn't need such high-quality entropy.

      Mirroring the existing asyncio create_server method the reuseaddr option
      for datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is 'posix' (except if
      the platform is Cygwin).
    - Issue #25304: Add asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe().  This lets you
      submit a coroutine to a loop from another thread, returning a
      concurrent.futures.Future.
    - Issue #25232: Fix CGIRequestHandler to split the query from the URL at the
      first question mark (?) rather than the last.
    - Issue #24657: Prevent CGIRequestHandler from collapsing slashes in the
      query part of the URL as if it were a path.
    - Issue #24483: C implementation of functools.lru_cache() now calculates
      key's hash only once.
    - Issue #22958: Constructor and update method of weakref.WeakValueDictionary
      now accept the self and the dict keyword arguments.

      wrong results in some cases.
    - Issue #23329: Allow the ssl module to be built with older versions of
      LibreSSL.
    - Issue #25319: When threading.Event is reinitialized, the underlying
      condition should use a regular lock rather than a recursive lock.
    - Issue #25099: Make test_compileall not fail when a entry on sys.path
      cannot be written to.
    - Issue #23919: Prevents assert dialogs appearing in the test suite.
  * Back-out the local patch for issue 21264, supposed to be fixed by #25099.
  * Adjust setting DH_COMPAT for dh_movefiles with updated debhelper supporting
    globbing of arguments. Closes: #800247.

python3.4 (3.4.3-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Python 3.4.3 release.
  * Changes since 20141202 (3.4.2-4):
    - Issue #22896: Avoid using PyObject_AsCharBuffer(),
      PyObject_AsReadBuffer(), and PyObject_AsWriteBuffer().
    - Issue #21295: Revert some changes (issue #16795) to AST line numbers and
      column offsets that constituted a regression.
    - Issue #21408: The default __ne__() now returns NotImplemented if __eq__()
      returned NotImplemented.

      replacment string longer than mailformed input data.
    - Issue #23048: Fix jumping out of an infinite while loop in the pdb.
    - Issue #23165: Perform overflow checks before allocating memory in the
      _Py_char2wchar function.

      PyEval_EvalFrameEx(). At entry, save or swap the exception state even if
      PyEval_EvalFrameEx() is called with throwflag=0. At exit, the exception
      state is now always restored or swapped, not only if why is WHY_YIELD or
      WHY_RETURN.
    - Issue #18518: timeit now rejects statements which can't be compiled
      outside a function or a loop (e.g. "return" or "break").
    - Issue #23094: Fixed readline with frames in Python implementation of
      pickle.
    - Issue #23268: Fixed bugs in the comparison of ipaddress classes.
    - Issue #21408: Removed incorrect implementations of __ne__() which didn't
      returned NotImplemented if __eq__() returned NotImplemented.  The default

      (malformed) headers with no key rather than amusing the body has started.

      internal reference to the selector mapping to break a reference cycle.
    - Issue #21356: Make ssl.RAND_egd() optional to support LibreSSL. The
      availability of the function is checked during the compilation.
    - Issue #20896, #22935: The :func:`ssl.get_server_certificate` function
      now uses the :data:`~ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23` protocol by default, not
      :data:`~ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3`, for maximum compatibility and support
      platforms where :data:`~ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3` support is disabled.
    - Issue #23111: In the ftplib, make ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv23 the default
      protocol version.

    - Issue #23016: A warning no longer produces an AttributeError when the
      program is run with pythonw.exe.
    - Issue #21775: shutil.copytree(): fix crash when copying to VFAT. An
      exception handler assumed that that OSError objects always have a
      'winerror' attribute.  That is not the case, so the exception handler
      itself raised AttributeError when run on Linux (and, presumably,
      any other non-Windows OS).
    - Issue #1218234: Fix inspect.getsource() to load updated source of
      reloaded module.

      information.

    - Issue #19548: Added some additional checks to test_codecs to ensure that
      statements in the updated documentation remain accurate.
    - Issue #15506: Use standard PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG autoconf macro in the
      configure script.
    - Issue #22935: Allow the ssl module to be compiled if openssl doesn't
      support SSL 3.
    - Issue #22079: PyType_Ready() now checks that statically allocated type
      has no dynamically allocated bases.
    - Issue #19548: Update the codecs module documentation to better cover the
      distinction between text encodings and other codecs, together with other
      clarifications.
    - Issue #22914: Update the Python 2/3 porting HOWTO to describe a more
      automated approach.
    - Issue #22735: Fix many edge cases (including crashes) involving custom
      mro() implementations.
    - Issue #23399: pyvenv creates relative symlinks where possible.

    - Issue #18982: Add tests for CLI of the calendar module.
    - Issue #23345: Prevent test_ssl failures with large OpenSSL patch level
      values (like 0.9.8zc).
  * Remove LTO sections from the static libraries.

      either always blocks or always fails (caused issues in the test suite).
    - hurd-path_max.dpatch (hurd only): change few PATH_MAX occurrences to
      MAXPATHLEN (which is defined by the python lib if not defined by the OS).

  [Matthias Klose]
  * Python 3.1 rc2 release. Closes: #529320.
  * Update to the trunk, 20090622, remove patches integrated upstream.
  * Configure with --with-fpectl --with-dbmliborder=bdb --with-wide-unicode.
    NOTE: The --with-wide-unicode configuration will break most extensions
    built with 3.1~a1, but is consistent with python2.x configurations.
  * Add symbols files for libpython3.1 and python3.1-dbg, don't include symbols
    from builtins, which can either be built as builtins or extensions.
  * Keep an empty lib-dynload in python3.1-minimal to avoid a warning on
    startup.
  * python3.1-doc: Depend on libjs-jquery, use jquery.js from this package.
    Closes: #523485.
  * Do not add /usr/lib/pythonXY.zip on sys.path.
  * Add symbols files for libpython3.1 and python3.1-dbg, don't include symbols

  * Keep an empty lib-dynload in python3.1-minimal to avoid a warning on
    startup.
  * Fix some lintian warnings.
  * Use the information in /etc/lsb-release for platform.dist(). LP: #196526.

    windows installers).
  * Document changes to the site directory name in the installation manual.
  * Don't build a profiled binary. Closes: #521811.

  * Address issues when working with PYTHONUSERBASE and non standard prefix
    (pointed out by Larry Hastings):
    - distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib(): Only return ".../dist-packages" if
      prefix is the default prefix and if PYTHONUSERBASE is not set in the
      environment.
    - site.addusersitepackages(): Add USER_BASE/.../dist-packages to sys.path.
  * Always use the `unix_prefix' scheme for setup.py install in a virtualenv
    setup. LP: #339904.
  * Don't make the setup.py install options --install-layout=deb and --prefix
    conflict with each other.
  * distutils: Always install into `/usr/local/lib/python3.1/dist-packages'
    if an option `--prefix=/usr/local' is present (except for virtualenv
    and PYTHONUSERBASE installations). LP: #362570.
  * Always use `site-packages' as site directory name in virtualenv.

    contents) via crafted arguments to (1) the tovideo method, and unspecified
    other vectors related to (2) imageop.c, (3) rbgimgmodule.c, and other

  * Python-2.5.1 release.
  * Build-depend on gcc-4.1 (>= 4.1.2-4) on alpha, powerpc, s390, sparc.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Add debian/patches/subprocess-eintr-safety.dpatch (LP: #87292):
      - Create and use wrappers around read(), write(), and os.waitpid() in the
        subprocess module which retry the operation on an EINTR (which happens
        if e. g. an alarm was raised while the system call was in progress).
        It is incredibly hard and inconvenient to sensibly handle this in
        applications, so let's fix this at the right level.
      - Patch based on original proposal of Peter <C3><85>strand
        in http://python.org/sf/1068268.
      - Add two test cases.
    - Change the interpreter to build and install python extensions
      built with the python-dbg interpreter with a different name into
      the same path (by appending `_d' to the extension name). The debug build
      of the interpreter tries to first load a foo_d.so or foomodule_d.so
      extension, then tries again with the normal name.
    - When trying to import the profile and pstats modules, don't
      exit, add a hint to the exception pointing to the python-profiler
      package, don't exit.
    - Keep the module version in the .egg-info name, only remove the
      python version.
    - python2.5-dbg: Install Misc/SpecialBuilds.txt, document the
      debug changes in README.debug.
  * Update to 20070425, taken from the 2.5 release branch.

python2.1 (2.1.1-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * README FOR PACKAGE MAINTAINERS: It is planned to remove the python2-XXX
    packages from unstable and move on to python2.1.
    If you repackage/adapt your modules for python2.1, don't build
    python2-XXX and python2.1-XXX packages from the same source package,
    so that the python2-XXX package can be removed without influencing the
    python2.1-XXX package.

    See the debian-python mailing list at http://lists.debian.org/devel.html
    for details and the current discussion and a draft for a debian-python
    policy (August to October 2001).

  * Remove alternative for /usr/bin/python. The python-base package now
    provides the default python version.

  * Regenerate control file to fix build dependencies (closes: #116190).
  * Remove alternative for /usr/bin/{python,pydoc}.
  * Provide a libpython2.1.so symlink in /usr/lib/python2.1/config,
    so that the shared library is found when -L/usr/lib/python2.1/config
    is specified.
  * Conflict with old package versions, where /usr/bin/python is a real
    program (closes: #115943).
  * python2.1-elisp conflicts with python-elisp (closes: #115895).
  * We now have 2.1 (closes: #96851, #107849, #110243).
