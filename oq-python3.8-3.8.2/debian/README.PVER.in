  Python @VER@ for Debian
  ---------------------

This is Python @VER@ packaged for Debian.

This document contains information specific to the Debian packages of
Python @VER@.



   [TODO: This document is not yet up-to-date with the packages.]

Currently, it features those two main topics:

  1. Release notes for the Debian packages:
  2. Notes for developers using the Debian Python packages:

Release notes and documentation from the upstream package are installed
in /usr/share/doc/@PVER@/.

There's a mailing list for discussion of issues related to Python on Debian
systems: debian-python@lists.debian.org. The list is not intended for
general Python problems, but as a forum for maintainers of Python-related
packages and interested third parties.



1. Release notes for the Debian packages:


Results of the regression test:
------------------------------

The package does successfully run the regression tests for all included
modules. Seven packages are skipped since they are platform-dependent and
can't be used with Linux.


2. Notes for developers using the Debian python packages:

See the draft of the Debian Python policy in /usr/share/doc/python.

distutils can be found in the @PVER@-dev package. Development files
like the python library or Makefiles can be found in the @PVER@-dev
package in /opt/openquake/lib/@OPVER@/config. Therefore, if you need to install 
a pure python extension, you only need @PVER@. On the other hand, to 
install a C extension, you need @PVER@-dev.

a) Locally installed Python add-ons

    /opt/openquake/lib/@OPVER@/site-packages/
    /opt/openquak/lib/site-python/ (version-independent modules)

b) Python add-ons packaged for Debian

    /opt/openquake/lib/@OPVER@/site-packages/
    /opt/openquake/lib/site-python/ (version-independent modules)

Note that no package must install files directly into /opt/openquake/lib/@OPVER@/
or /opt/openquake/lib/@OPVER@/. Only the site-packages directory is allowed
for third-party extensions.

Use of the new `package' scheme is strongly encouraged. The `ni' interface
is obsolete in python 1.5.

Header files for extensions go into /opt/openquake/include/@OPVER@/.


Installing extensions for local use only:
----------------------------------------

Consider using distutils ...

Most extensions use Python's Makefile.pre.in. Note that Makefile.pre.in
by default will install files into /opt/openquake/lib/, not into /opt/openquake/lib/,
which is not allowed for local extensions. You'll have to change the
Makefile accordingly. Most times, "make prefix=/opt/openquake install" will
work.
